Finished rock paper scissors project. I learned a lot and man am I glad it's over.

Maintaining professionalism--

-Rock Paper Scissors -- Odin Project
-Input: Rock, Paper, or Scissors 5 different times
-Console.log player choice, computer choice, and winner
-Show game winner and score at the end

I learned a lot of things involving functions; function comparisons, calling in functions, parameters of functions, etc.
I also learned how different operations work and how to properly handle condition statements
